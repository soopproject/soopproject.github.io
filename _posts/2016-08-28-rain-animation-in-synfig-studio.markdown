To create a basic rain animation in Synfig Studio, you just need to follow the next steps.

1. Create the background you want and a noisy gradient.

2. Change one of the colors of the gradient to semitransparent white and the other in transparent.

3. Edit the size of the noisy gradient until you find the size that you like. (the width must be smaller)

4. And finally create the animation, to do this we have to change the parameters of "Animation Speed". The higher the value, the faster it moves.

Ready, you can improve some aspects with the experience. And if you want to change the direction of the rain just move the gradient inside a folder and rotate it.
